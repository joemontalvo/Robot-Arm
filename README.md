# Robot Arm

### The 3D Model

The model I used was from Thingiverse and originally created by [Ben-Tommy Eriksen](https://www.thingiverse.com/bentommye/designs), I used a modified version of the arm which was created by [Holger](https://www.thingiverse.com/holgero/designs). The model can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:65081).
